# On Probability Estimation for Unbalanced Classification

This repository contains codes for simulating and evaluating various balancing strategies under unbalanced data scenarios. We demonstrate how random oversampling, random undersampling, and class weighting techniques influence posterior probability estimates and show how to correct their biases to get more accurate estimates. The project includes both synthetic simulations and real-data analysis using the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset.
